# Advent of Code 2019

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/) Problems. I'll try to add some explanation on my approaches.

## Advent of Code

Advent of Code is a set of programming puzzles released one by one on each day of december. First day problems are seems to be easier, the difficulty increases each day. It is not a competitive contest, I have seen people use it to learn a new language or try new programming practices. It is my first year participating in, my goal is to solve the problems in python, maybe explore other approaches to solution and I'm planning to write some notes here on my solutions like a blog post.
