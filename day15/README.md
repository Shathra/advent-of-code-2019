## Day 15

It is a maze puzzle. After playing with it some time, I think that maze contains no loop so it is simply a tree. There is an algorithm called [Wall Follower] which guarentees to traverse all maze by obeying a simple rule: Touch the wall with your left hand and go forward. If maze does not have a loop, the agent traverses every tile and returns to the starting point. I got the following maze layout when I tried it :

```

 - `#` = Wall
 - `.` = Passage
 - `$` = Desired end point


### Part 1 & Part 2

Part 1 asks the minimum distance from starting point to desired point. Breadth first search (BFS) gives the answer.

Part 2 asks the furthes point from the desired point. I modified BFS method slightly to get the answer.

Source codes: [part1.py](part1.py), [part2.py](part2.py)

Also, I added a STOP_SIGNAL into [intcode interpreter](intcode.py) because this maze program never halts so I needed a way to tell interpreter to stop when whole maze is traversed.
